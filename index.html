    <h1>Rip Curl - The Ultimate Surfing Company</h1><br>
    <h2>FOUNDED IN 1969 BY BRIAN SINGER AND DOUG “CLAW” WARBRICK, RIP CURL IS ONE OF THE WORLD’S MOST RECOGNIZED AND RESPECTED BRANDS. IT HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE SURF AND SNOW SCENES SINCE ITS CREATION.</h2><br>
    <div class="about-type">
      <p>
        Rip Curl is a company for, and about, the crew on The Search. The Search is the driving force that led to the creation of Rip Curl, and it lives in the spirit of everything the Rip Curl crew do. It's what makes Rip Curl unique. It defines
        who
        we are. The products we make, the events we run, the riders we support and the people we reach globally, are all a part of that Search that Rip Curl is on.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        Rip Curl remains a company built by surfers for surfers, and we’ve been market leaders in surfing for over 50 years. We endeavour to make the best products, run the best events, support the best athletes, deliver the best customer service,
        communicate the best brand message and have the best crew of people. This helps Rip Curl hold a vision of being regarded as The Ultimate Surfing Company.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        As a part of that vision, Rip Curl has forever prided itself on having the world’s best surf team. That statement is none truer than today. Rip Curl athletes are World Champions. They are innovators, dreamers, role models and Searchers. From
        global elite athletes to regional rising talents, no matter where you are in the world the best surfers will be riding with a Rip Curl sticker on the nose of their board.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        Rip Curl also has an extraordinary events platform, headlined by WSL World Championship Tour surfing contests, the global GromSearch Series and an array of international events across surf and snow. We were the first company to sponsor a
        professional surfing event, the 1973 Rip Curl Pro at Bells Beach, and we’re committed to continue the tradition of supporting and showcasing the best surfing to fans across the globe.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        Rip Curl will continue to stick by the grass roots that helped make us the market leader in surfing, but we'll also charge on into the future and push riding to a new level. We know what we are doing and we will be around for a long time
